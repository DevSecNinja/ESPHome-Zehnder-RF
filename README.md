## Fork notes
I'm using an ESP8266 NodeMCU V2 board. Make sure to follow the PIN structure. I'll update the `utility-bridge.yaml` file with my config once I have it all worked out. Below my notes that you can't get from the code:

- The pairing didn't work for me after trying many forks. Disconnecting the CE (D2) PIN worked for me and suddently the device started to work!
